## About

BuildIn is a simple tool that displays the build status of a repository using a traffic-semaphore style indicator (e.g. red, yellow, green). It is designed to make build status easy to glance at in dashboards or embedded views.

---

## Features

- Uses a traffic light metaphor (red / yellow / green) for build status  
- Meant to be repository-agnostic: works with typical CI/CD pipelines  
- Lightweight, minimal visual overhead  
- Easy to embed or integrate  

---

## Motivation

When managing multiple repositories or monitoring many CI pipelines, it can be tedious to check each status individually. BuildIn provides an intuitive, visual summary of build health using a traffic-semaphore style indicator, allowing quicker assessment at a glance.

## Usage

> **Note:** These are suggested steps. Adjust as needed based on your CI, deployment, or display environment.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
